          <p class="lead">My name is Dan Coxon and I am currently a 4th-year 'Computing with IT Management' student in
            the Institute of Technology Tallaght. I am ambitious in the area of UX/UI Design and Web Development. Some
            of the subjects I have studied in my time in IT Tallaght are Software Development, using languages such as
            Java, Database Fundamentals, Operating Systems Fundamentals, Object-Oriented Systems Analysis, Social Media
            Communications, Statistics and Web Design & Development.</p>

                in a live cover band in venues all over Dublin. I play a variety of instruments but my two main instruments are
                the piano and the guitar. I am also a song-writer and have been performing for large audiences since
                2011.</p>

During my 6 months working there, this website saw multiple updates that I was involved with. At the beginning of my placement, myself and two other student interns were tasked with carrying out an Heuristic Evaluation of this website. The results of which could be used to carry out any potential updates to the website.</p>
                                <h5 class="animated fadeIn"><b>Marketing Communications (MarComms)</b></h5>
                                <p class="animated fadeIn">MarComms was a large responsibility of mine during my internship. This role consisted of the sourcing and scheduling of all social media content across all of Graphic Mint's social channels including <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/graphic_mint">Twitter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://facebook.com/graphicmint">Facebook</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/graphic-mint/">LinkedIn</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/116801234347174627850">Google+</a>. At the end of each month I then had to complete a variety of reports detailing the analytics from each social media platform and each of Graphic Mint's websites and then carry out a presentation in which these metrics would be discussed. Plans would then be set in place for any changes that needed to be made to the marketing strategy based on the month's performance. Other roles and responsibilities I had during my time in Graphic Mint included <a target="_blank" href="https://graphicmint.com/blog/social-media-business/">Blog Writing</a>, Blog editing and the creation of quarterly newsletters.</p>

                                <p class="animated fadeIn">A large project that I was involved with for this website was in the area of photography. I carried multiple photoshoots over a period of approximately 4 weeks that would later be used in various areas of Graphic Mint's websites.

During my internship the website received a full redesign which I was involved with. I received the new design for the website from the UI & Interaction Design team and was then tasked with developing this new design along with the UI Developer.</p> 
                            <p class="animated fadeIn">This was a great experience as it allowed me to expand my practice of Web Development, learn and understand the process in which the design is broken down into sections and building blocks and then piecing it all together into the final build of the website. I learned a lot during this process under the supervision of Graphic Mint's UI Developer.</p>

                          <p class="animated fadeIn">This was a large client project that I was involved with during my internship and consisted of building a new website for Dorset College located in Dublin City. The project itself spanned across roughly 4 months of my internship and it was a great to be part of such a substantial project during my time there. It was very hands on in terms of development as it involved the utilisation of a Content Management System (CMS) called Drupal. This came with a steep learning curve and as it was something I had never used before. Once I got a better understanding of it I was delegated pieces of functionality to develop by the team's UI Developer. After developing this functionality for a set period of time I would then present my work so that it could then be tested, iterated on and then implemented into the final build of the website.</p>
                          <p class="animated fadeIn">Other roles and responsibilities I was delegated as part of this project was working alongside Graphic Mint's content strategist to organise and prepare all of the content that was sent to us by Dorset College that would later be implemented onto the website. I was also involved with Quality Assurance and Testing the websites functionality and usability during the latter stages of development.</p>

                            <p class="animated fadeIn">This was a large project undertaken by the interns during our time in Graphic Mint. The aim of the Demo Reel was to give an overview, in the form of a video, of the core service offerings of Graphic Mint across their 4 initiatives. This included their <a target="_blank" href="https://graphicmint.com/services/">UX/UI Design and Web, Branding & Customer Experience (CX)</a> services, <a target="_blank" href="https://uxacademy.ie">UXAcademy.ie</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://usabilitytesting.ie">Usabilitytesting.ie</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://participants.ie">Participants.ie</a>. 
                            <p class="animated fadeIn">The process of creating the final animation video included many stages. As with all projects, it began with an initial kick-off meeting where we were briefed on the expected outcomes of the project. We then went on to brainstorming, storyboarding and prototyping with many meetings and iterations in between.</p>
                            <p class="animated fadeIn">I was then responsible for the music production side of the project. I enjoyed this as I got to use my passion for music and also video editing to help bring Graphic Mint's demo reel to life.</p>
